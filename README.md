# M2-QuillenSuslin
The source code for the QuillenSuslin package for Macaulay2.  The package provides methods for computing bases of projective modules over polynomial and Laurent polynomial rings and for completion of unimodular matrices over such rings.  A paper describing the methods made available in this package, [Computing Free Bases for Projective Modules](http://msp.org/jsag/2013/5-1/p05.xhtml), was published in the [Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry](http://www.j-sag.org).  This project is joint work with Branden Stone.
